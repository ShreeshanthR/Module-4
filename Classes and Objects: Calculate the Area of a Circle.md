# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
class cse:
    def __init__(self,r):
        self.r=r
    def mech(self):
        c=3.141592*self.r*self.r
        print(f"Area of circle: {c:.2f}")
        
radius=int(input())
obj=cse(radius)
obj.mech()
```

## Result
Thus, the Python program that calculates the area of a circle using a class and its method has been successfully created and executed.
